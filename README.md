# DYNAMIC A2OJ
Easily track your ladder progress -> 
https://a2oj.herokuapp.com/

Since our all time favourite A20J ladders became static, my laziness to solve problems systematically took over me. Recently when I sat again to start solving problems the static ladder frustrated me a lot. I missed A2OJ a lot :-( and probably many of you guys also miss the dynamic A2OJ. Hence this, to help and motivate myself but eventually thought why not to share the fun.

PS - I'm still not doing anything expect being lazy :-()

## Contributions Section

#### How to install:
1. Create a folder (a20j-contribution)
2. Create a virtual environment
```
py -m venv env
```
Now, you have to activate the environment.
Go to the 'settings.json' in '.vscode' file and add the 'Script' file complete path.
In this way your environment will be activated.

3. Cloning the repo
1. Fork the repo
Now, go 'a20j-contribution', and clone your forked repo (don't try to clone the main repo (subodhk01/a2oj)). Your cloned repo should be directly inside the 'a20j-contribution' folder.
Inside the 'a20j-contribution' type ```ls``` and you can see the 'env' folder and 'a2oj' folder.
4. Installing all the dependencies(using requirements.txt)
Inside the 'a20j-contribution'; type ```cd a2oj```. This will take you inside the your local repo of 'a2oj'. 
Now, type ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```. This will install all the dependencies mentoned in the 'requirements.txt' file. (Help[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41457612/how-to-use-requirements-txt-to-install-all-dependencies-in-a-python-project])
