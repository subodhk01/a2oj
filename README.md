# DYNAMIC A2OJ
Easily track your ladder progress -> 
https://a2oj.herokuapp.com/

Since our all time favourite A20J ladders became static, my laziness to solve problems systematically took over me. Recently when I sat again to start solving problems the static ladder frustrated me a lot. I missed A2OJ a lot :-( and probably many of you guys also miss the dynamic A2OJ. Hence this, to help and motivate myself but eventually thought why not to share the fun.

PS - I'm still not doing anything expect being lazy :-()

## Contributions Section

#### How to install:
- Create a folder (a20j-contribution)
- Create a virtual environment
```
py -m venv env
```
Now, you have to activate the environment.
Go to the 'settings.json' in '.vscode' file and add and replace the 'Script' file complete path.
In this way your environment will be activated.

- Cloning the repo
*Fork the repo
*Now, go 'a20j-contribution', and clone your forked repo (don't try to clone the main repo (subodhk01/a2oj)). Your cloned repo should be directly inside the 'a20j-   contribution' folder.
*Inside the 'a20j-contribution' type ```ls``` and you can see the 'env' folder and 'a2oj' folder.
- Installing all the dependencies(using requirements.txt)
*Inside the 'a20j-contribution'; type ```cd a2oj```. This will take you inside the your local repo of 'a2oj'. 
*Now, type ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```. This will install all the dependencies mentoned in the 'requirements.txt' file. (Help[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41457612/how-to-use-requirements-txt-to-install-all-dependencies-in-a-python-project])
