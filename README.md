# DYNAMIC A2OJ
Easily track your ladder progress ->

Since our all time favourite A20J ladders became static, my laziness to solve problems systematically took over me. Recently when I sat again to start solving problems the static ladder frustrated me a lot. I missed A2OJ a lot :-( and probably many of you guys also miss the dynamic A2OJ. Hence this, to help and motivate myself but eventually thought why not to share the fun.

PS - I'm still not doing anything except being lazy :-()
