# DYNAMIC A2OJ

Easily track your ladder progress =>

Since our all time favourite A2OJ ladders became static, my laziness to solve problems systematically took over me. Recently when I sat again to start solving problems the static ladder frustrated me a lot. I missed A2OJ so much :-( and thought probably many of you guys also miss the dynamic A2OJ. So I made this to motivate myself and eventually thought why not share the fun.

PS - I'm still not doing anything except being lazy  :-)
